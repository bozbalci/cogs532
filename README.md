# Theoretical Linguistics

In Spring 2019, I took a [Theoretical Linguistics course](https://github.com/umutozge/theoretical-linguistics). Given by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Umut Özge](https://umutozge.github.io/), it was easily one of the most enjoyable courses I've taken in my undergraduate career. Digging into the mechanical foundations of language was an eye-opening experience.
